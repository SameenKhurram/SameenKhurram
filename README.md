## About Me

Hi, I'm Sameen Khurram. I have a BSc. (Hons) from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and I’m a passionate Data Scientist. I use data analytics and visualization to find important insights and help make better decisions based on data.

I love turning raw data into useful information. I've successfully worked on projects like sales analytics, customer segmentation, retention strategies, and data analysis. I’m skilled in using SQL, advanced Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python to support data-driven business decisions.

I also have expertise in machine learning and convolutional neural networks, which I use to build models that can predict outcomes and recognize patterns in data. This allows me to develop advanced solutions that can solve complex problems and improve business processes.

I work well with different teams to identify important metrics, improve data processes, and set up scalable analytics solutions. My strong analytical skills and attention to detail help me deliver valuable insights that boost revenue, improve customer engagement, and promote data-driven cultures.
